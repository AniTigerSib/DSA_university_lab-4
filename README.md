## Substring search algorythms
Task:
1. Develop a function, realizing one of the substring search algorythms
2. Explore the algorithms for searching for the implemented function and the functions of the standard strstr library: to build and compare the dependencies of the average execution time on the size of the text and the size of the sample. When researching algorithms, pay special attention to the formation of the text in which the search is performed.
